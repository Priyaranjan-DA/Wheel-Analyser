# 🚆 Wheel Analyser – Predictive Maintenance for Chennai Metro Rail (CMRL)

> An intelligent, interactive web platform that helps CMRL monitor, visualize, and predict **axle-level wheel wear** across all 52 trains – ensuring safety, efficiency, and zero downtime.

---

## 📊 Overview

**Wheel Analyser** is a full-stack application built to revolutionize how CMRL monitors wheel health. Using historical wheel data, machine learning models, and modern UI/UX, the platform:

- Visualizes train-wise and axle-wise wheel data.
- Predicts Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for each axle.
- Sends timely alerts for replacements.
- Offers clean and accessible interfaces for engineers and maintenance teams.
